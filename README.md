# Marketing Spend Optimisation

A proof-of-concept on using Markov Chains to optimise marketing spend.

## Project Aim

Demonstrate techniques to:
- Analyse a dataset
- Approach to preparing the dataset for machine learning
- Segment the customer data and what the recommended number of groups is
- Identify what is different about each group
- Visualise the differences

## Project Background

Many companies are not able to use the data captured when a customer or lead engages with them to shape their marketing spend.  Specifically within the context of a campaign.

This project is a proof-of-concept demonstrating the use of Markov Chains to identify the optimal channel marketing spend.

## Project Benefits

- A repeatable method optimising future marketing campaign spend by channel.

## Project Objectives

Present an approach to maxmimizing the ROI on a marketing campaign.

## Project Scope

- Generate test data that is indicative of real-life.
- Build a model using Markov Chains.
- Given a campaign budget, be able to identify the optimal division of spend by channel.

### Organizational Context

The project is sponsored by the CMO and Managing Director.

### Project Will Include

- This is a proof-of-concept only, using test data.
- Databricks will be used as the development platform.
- Python notebook demonstrating use of machine learning and data engineering techniques.

### Project Will Not Include

No production data will be used for this proof-of-concept.

### Project Files

The project files must be executed in the following order.

1. 01_create_test_data
